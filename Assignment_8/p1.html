            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This was my 15–112 Term Project of Spring 2021 created from scratch in Python with 
                no imported packages and simply using TKinter graphics. In this game, the user 
                will have to navigate through a randomized maze while avoiding different obstacles. 
                Obstacles include spikes, repetitive missiles, and chasing lava. As the player is 
                traversing, there will be coins to collect to increase their score as well as different 
                levels with increasing difficulty. The objective of the game is to reach an exit door 
                also known as a new dimension, hence the name.​ The most difficult part in creating this 
                project was developing the randomized maze algorithm. Since the user moves in “hard” 
                directions, where any key-arrow pressed will trigger the character to jump to the immediate 
                wall that is eligible, I had to take into account valid moves, exit spaces, obstacles as 
                well as other triggers for debugging purposes in the creation. In the end, everything was 
                successful and this is a fully functioning game with a leaderboard, username input, pause/play 
                button, and a restart option.</p>
