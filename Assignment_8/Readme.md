I. What is the purpose of my website:
    The purpose of my website is to clearly display my work to future hiring managers or peers interested in seeing the work I have produced. The goal was to allow users to calmly interact with the website. I wanted to be sure that the design was minimilist and clean while also keeping funcitonality.
II. Information
    The information I wanted to convey through my website was strictly work related. I wanted to be able to clearly explain the process of my work as well as the "why". Some other information I wanted to convey through my website was my background and type of student I am. 
III. Interesting and Engaging
    How is my website interesting and engaging? On the home page it displays pictures of my projects which users can hover over and then proceed to read more if interested. I think this is an interesting feature because it shows users a sneak peak of the full project and its facets. In other ways it is intersting and engaging is when you first view the website my greeting bobbles up and down which I thought was a nice animation.
IV. Target Audience
    The target audience are hiring managers and peers intersted in seeing my work. 

Using My Website
    Users should scroll up and down the home page, and which ever project picture peaks their interest, they can click and be directed towards the detail page.

External Tools
    I used animations and attempted to use Bootstrap to enhance my project. 

Iteration from HW7
    I changed from my original design a tad because it was too difficult to implement a menu sidebar that shift everything left once clicked on. It was tedious and I had to move forward with a different design to help speed up my process.

Major Challenges:
    Some major challenges I encountered were getting the CSS to affect the right elements I wanted. After a while I began to get a little lost despite having tried keep the code clean.
